Hey, Iâ€™m @nuckypuck. I'm a student @ university studying Comp Sci 

   -  I research any topics that interest me, such as computing. (That's where I get all my trivial knowledge.) 
   -  I enjoy games (too many to list) and activities such as rugby, climbing and skiing.
   -  I studied computer science, politics & finance. 

I'm learning various programming languages to develop my fluency and coding skills. As I create projects and complete courses, I'll upload my learnings here. 
I'm also revisiting maths from GCSE, A-Level, and up to University Level as it is a precursor to advanced topics in computer science and I'd like to develop my ability to the fullest.
I plan to document my journey as much as possible and will do so here and through other means.

If I'd do anything differently, I'd have picked a science (Chemistry or Physics), Maths and Further Maths, and kept Comp Sci and Finance.
I didn't genuinely begin enjoying these subjects the way I did and studying them until I got to university, but better late than never.
