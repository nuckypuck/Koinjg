Hey, Iâ€™m @nuckypuck. I'm a student @ university studying Comp Sci 

   -  I research any topics that interest me, such as computing. (That's where I get all my trivial knowledge.) 
   -  I enjoy games (too many to list) and activities such as rugby, climbing and skiing.
   -  I studied computer science, politics & finance. 

I'm learning various programming languages to develop my fluency and coding skills. As I create projects and complete courses, I'll upload my learnings here. 
I'm also revisiting maths from GCSE, A-Level, and up to University Level as it is a precursor to advanced topics in computer science and I'd like to develop my ability to the fullest.
I plan to document my journey as much as possible and will do so here and through other means.

If I'd do anything differently, I'd have picked a science (Chemistry or Physics), Maths and Further Maths, and kept Comp Sci and Finance.
I didn't genuinely begin enjoying these subjects the way I did and studying them until I got to university, but better late than never. 

As far as plans go;
Educationally:
I will spend as much time as possible engaged with events related to my degree and those that interest me, EG. New Scientist Live (Where I had the privilege of being an Exhibitor).
I will learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, React, Python, MySQL, the C family, and more, to a level of understanding, and then further develop these.
I will develop my fluency in Excel, Linux and other software.
I will learn Maths at all levels, such as Discrete Math, Calculus, and Statistics.
I will complete courses and certificates related to my degree and those of interest to me such as ethical hacking.
I will complete the Neetcode 150, Princeton Algorithms 1 & 2 and develop my leet code skills.
I will pursue AI as my final year module, alongside cyber security (if possible).
I will graduate with a first with honours.
I will complete a master's in Computer Science or AI. 
Personally:
I'd like to engage more in my hobbies, including games, skiing, climbing, rugby and airsoft.
I'd like to keep active in the gym and stay fit
I will stick to all my plans, continue to educate myself, travel the world and do something that genuinely matters.
