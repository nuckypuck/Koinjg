Hey, Iâ€™m @nuckypuck. I'm a student @ university studying Comp Sci 

   -  I research any topics that interest me, such as computing. (That's where I get all my trivial knowledge.) 
   -  I enjoy games (too many to list) and activities such as rugby, climbing and skiing.
   -  I studied computer science, politics & finance. 

Currently, I'm working with various programming languages to develop my fluency in them and my skills in coding.
I'm also revising maths from GCSE, A-Level and up to University Level as it'll assist me in my course and it's generally a good skill.

If I'd do anything differently, I'd have picked a science (Chemistry or Physics), maths and further maths, and kept comp sci and finance. 
I didn't genuinely begin enjoying these subjects the way I did and studying them until I got to university, but better late than never.
